# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository focuses on solving the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** problem by applying various machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions. The dataset `creditcard.csv` contains transaction data with features such as transaction amount, time, and user information, while the target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. We use multiple machine learning algorithms to build models, including **Decision Tree Classifier**, **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. 

The code first processes the data by checking for missing values, visualizing class distributions, and splitting it into training and test sets. Then, the models are trained on the training set, and predictions are made on the test set. Each model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The **SVM** model achieved the highest accuracy of **94.5%**, showcasing its ability to effectively identify fraudulent transactions. Additionally, decision trees and logistic regression are also evaluated, with each model providing valuable insights into performance and feature importance.

In this repository, we also use **seaborn** and **matplotlib** to visualize the results, including confusion matrices and feature importance from decision trees. The project leverages libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation. The code is designed to offer an easy-to-understand workflow for applying machine learning models to fraud detection tasks and can serve as a foundation for more complex fraud detection systems.
